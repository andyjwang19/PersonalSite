The Vendry has several services, the primary one being their venue search, which allows hosts and companies to look through a carefully curated dataset of venues. An important aspect of the users' evaluations of a particular venue would be any awards the venue has won. This is the service I added. I worked on the full-stack of this service, from creating and designing the database to store necessary values, writing API paths for the frontend to get the values from the backend, to a front end display. The Frontend display included an option in the search bar for all users to see, as well as an inward facing interface for admins to manipulate the database.",
