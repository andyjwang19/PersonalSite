I provided a menu of the most popular and well known drinks from the early 2000s, of which she selected five. I designed the menu in Adobe Illustrator, working with the client's vision. I provided the client with estimates on a complete shopping list for the event, which they purchased and provided. Overall this event was a blast!"
